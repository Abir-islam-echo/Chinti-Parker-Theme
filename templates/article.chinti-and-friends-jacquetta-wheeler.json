I found shepherd’s huts and tipis on Air BnB in Devon and Cornwall to stay in, and really loved it. They showed me that you don’t have to spend a fortune traveling to enjoy a good holiday.  Devon was so beautiful, I was so lucky with the weather.  I wondered why I would go anywhere else!  Church Cove in Cadgwith was a special find. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_Jacquetta_Wheeler_8.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>How do you stay creative?

I love taking pictures of my children, or anything that I might pass or witness that I find exciting.  For example, the kids and I were in Kent last Spring and a huge lorry full of sheep showed up in the field next to us, about to unload.  I grabbed my camera and shot out there with the kids and got some great shots of them transfixed by the sheep. I then love to play around with my pictures using developing software such as Lightroom, and can spend hours editing. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_Jacquetta_Wheeler_9.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"e5b6124a-ae3b-4511-b582-7c36d23c12b7":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749841883214__e5b6124a-ae3b-4511-b582-7c36d23c12b7-16850283369fa6b839-0":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Talk about your brand","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>Use this text to share information about your brand with your customers.
