Sophie Ellis-Bextor, the beloved singer, and mother of five, has long been an ambassador for Save The Children.  <\/p><p>Her passion for supporting this charitable organisation took a creative turn this year when she collaborated with Chinti & Parker to design a limited-edition 'mini-me' recycled cashmere blend jumper that's available for both adults and children.  <\/p><p>This striking red sweater, knitted from 70% recycled merino and 30% sustainable cashmere, showcases an intarsia pink heart bearing the word 'Love,' inspired by Sophie's own tattoo on her arm. The jumpers retail at £95 and £45 respectively for adults and children, with 100% of the profits being donated to Save the Children. <\/p><p>With every purchase, a complimentary tattoo sheet will be included, and these sheets will also be available for individual purchase at £5 each. The proceeds from these sales will support the treatment of children with pneumonia and the provision of birth kits for midwives. <\/p><p>  <\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/sophie-ellis-bextor-x-save-the-children-collection\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Click here to shop the collection<\/span><\/a> <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Untitled_design_57.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","disabled":true,"settings":{"grid-title":"How You Can Help?","grid-title-font-size":30,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p> Here's how you can make a difference:  <\/p><p>   <\/p><p>Donate: Your contributions can  help children get the food, healthcare and education they need to get the future they deserve. <\/p><p>Campaign: Raise your voice to influence policies that create a better world. <\/p><p>Volunteer: Offer your time and skills to volunteer in one of Save the Children’s charity shops, fundraising groups or as a campaigner. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Volunteer: Offer your time and skills to support their programs and advocacy efforts. <\/p><p>Advocate: Raise your voice to influence policies that benefit children in need. <\/p><p>Sponsor a Child: Establish a personal connection with a child in need by sponsoring their education, healthcare, and well-being. <\/p><p>  <\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.savethechildren.org.uk\/donate-today?cid=pse-gpdonatehubkeyword_AQ1002001-oa_001-1F97289QE&ppc=true&ppc=true&matchtype=e&matchtype=e&s_keyword=save%252520the%252520children&s_keyword=save%252520the%252520children&adposition=&adposition=&s_kwcid=AL!9048!3!655802262674!e!!g!!save%252520the%252520children&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwysipBhBXEiwApJOcu3ad0vY_KiOk7adIO7nwDAtPeQCCw91Sldmmzmaet0Grr9OMPkNZeRoCNUAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds \" title=\"https:\/\/www.savethechildren.org.uk\/donate-today?cid=pse-gpdonatehubkeyword_AQ1002001-oa_001-1F97289QE&ppc=true&ppc=true&matchtype=e&matchtype=e&s_keyword=save%252520the%252520children&s_keyword=save%252520the%252520children&adposition=&adposition=&s_kwcid=AL!9048!3!655802262674!e!!g!!save%252520the%252520children&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwysipBhBXEiwApJOcu3ad0vY_KiOk7adIO7nwDAtPeQCCw91Sldmmzmaet0Grr9OMPkNZeRoCNUAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds \">Click here for more info & to donate: <\/a><\/p><p> <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/CH1220754__DSC0895_jpg.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}}},"order":["67f671b0-75eb-4dd8-8013-a054020dfc99","blog-title","7d5142a8-bc3f-4c31-b8e5-7010274b4d78","3f551c6c-c4be-4931-a8e5-21d785e5f6dc","1663868435f0c44a9a","90bd636b-f1cf-410e-b990-979dcd76b03c","16638720430f34827e","166387328793cd4683"]}
