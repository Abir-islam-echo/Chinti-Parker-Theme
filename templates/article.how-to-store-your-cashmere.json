Here at Chinti and Parker, our cashmere comes from the Capra hircus goat in Mongolia, Northern China, which requires much more delicate handling than other fabrics, both man-made and natural. Storing your cashmere correctly after it has been washed and dried with care is simply the next step in guaranteeing that your piece - whether it’s a cashmere jumper or cashmere loungewear - will last for years to come. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Keep bugs at bay<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Moths love cashmere. Especially cashmere with a hint of moisture within its fibres. And once they get in, they’re extremely difficult to get rid of. This is why it’s so important to take preventative measures. Proper storage techniques - whether it’s the right boxes or repellants - will make all the difference in keeping your cashmere free from holes. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_store_your_cashmere_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>How to store cashmere <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Now that we’ve covered the why, we come to the how. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_store_your_cashmere_3.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>1. Fold, don’t hang <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Whilst you may see hanging your most beloved pieces - such as jumpers and cardigans - as a must-do, it can actually damage the fabric. We recommend that cashmere is always folded rather than hung as hanging can put pressure on the shoulders which can lead to stretching and weakened seams.  <br\/><br\/>To fold your cashmere jumper, lay it flat with the front facing down. Bring each side of the jumper inwards, approximately a third of the way, and fold the hem to meet the shoulders. This technique is suitable for both everyday and long-term storage. <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":20,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"021fd789-c252-4f93-8380-ee20f4dcb956":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_store_your_cashmere_4.jpg","width":"100%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>2. Box carefully<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Once folded, choose your storage method wisely, particularly for long-term storage. Cardboard should be avoided at all costs as it won’t keep out heat and moisture, and can attract cashmere-loving critters. And although they are cheap and space-saving, plastic boxes are also a no-go. Plastic can trap heat and moisture which can wreak havoc on your sensitive cashmere. Too much trapped moisture can even cause mildew or mould to grow, causing stains or bad odours. <br\/><br\/>Specialist garment bags are the safest way to store cashmere, both in the short term and between seasons. For extra protection, line your garment bags with anti-moth paper strips or drawer liners. <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"1e74fa84-52c0-405e-8fef-73f1a59450bf":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>3. Keep moths at bay <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Although cheap and convenient, avoid moth balls at all costs. They contain harsh chemicals and their odour can linger on your clothes despite proper washing. Use cedar blocks and lavender sachets - the best natural deterrents - but take care to ensure they don’t come into direct contact with your clothes as the oils can stain. You’ll also need to remember to replace them each season as their smell - and therefore their efficacy - will fade. <br\/><br\/> <br\/><em><strong>4. Control the climate <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Hot and humid spots in your home are the perfect breeding ground for mold and for attracting moths. So you should avoid storing your cashmere in basements or attics. Extreme temperatures - both hot and cold - can damage the fabric, and direct sunlight can cause colour to fade.  <\/p><p><br\/>Ideally your cashmere should be stored, within its proper container, in a cool, dark and dry space such as your bedroom or a closet. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"a5bd02f3-16cb-480d-9c70-8590da759227":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_store_your_cashmere_5.jpg","width":"100%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"f3dc05e1-8d35-4be0-834d-148eff2ec04c":{"type":"cta","settings":{"padding-top":20,"padding-bottom":0,"title":"Cashmere Care Guide","url":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/pages\/cashmere-care","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"cta_bg":"","cta_border_color":"","cta_border":1,"align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","021fd789-c252-4f93-8380-ee20f4dcb956","11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae","1e74fa84-52c0-405e-8fef-73f1a59450bf","a5bd02f3-16cb-480d-9c70-8590da759227","f3dc05e1-8d35-4be0-834d-148eff2ec04c"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-boxy-sweater","black-cashmere-comfort-sweater","black-cashmere-crew-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","6655605c-9aaa-45ca-9189-ddf8b741fc37","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387311379593d63","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
