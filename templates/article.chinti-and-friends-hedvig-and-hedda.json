Our days are based around structure and routine. We fit in a variety of activities like workouts, home-schooling, reading, teamwork, and we try to spend as much time going for walks and playing in the garden as the weather allows. <br\/><br\/> <br\/><em><strong>What have been the main challenges or surprises for you personally? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>I'm very positive at heart and try to make the best out of each situation, even the bad ones, so it hasn't really been so challenging except that I miss family, friends, and hugs immensely. What has been a surprise though, is how easily we both have adjusted to lockdown and how I've managed to come up with solutions to tricky things on my own. Grocery shopping, for instance – I never had any luck ordering grocery deliveries, and as a single mum with no car living on the 4th floor with no lift and shopping trips limited to once a week, I quickly realised the only solution was to get a shopping trolley. I've sworn by it since the day I got it and will continue doing so from now on. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Hedvig_and_Hedda_1.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>Can you tell us a little about your experience of home-schooling your daughter? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>We actually started home-schooling before the lockdown as we were isolating a few weeks earlier. I never imagined I would be doing this now but it's going very well, and my daughter works very hard. Now, a few months in, I see how much she has grown and developed during this time and I think she has progressed on the topics we’ve covered a lot more than she would have during normal school days. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>What does a typical day in your house look like?  <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>We kick off our mornings with her doing PE sessions online and me practicing my daily yoga. This is followed by a structured school day until 4pm where my daughter follows her maths and English programmes. I'm always around if she needs my help to step in and assist with new topics but most of it she handles on her own and I receive all her results in my mailbox to keep track. We also do some creative work, playtime and reading up on our chosen topic of the week. The last few weeks we've focused on anti-racism and I've found her books and movies that highlight this topic, which has been valuable learning for myself as well. On really beautiful days we've taken the home-schooling to our garden or local parks and started seeing smaller groups of friends outside. At night we're both tired of books so we make nice dinners and watch movies or paint. My daughter and I were already best friends, and very much in sync, but the time in lockdown has been even more bonding for us. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"05c6d4fb-7720-40f5-9b36-b00c0561acf1":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>“My daughter and I were already best friends, and very much in sync, but the time in lockdown has been even more bonding for us.” <\/strong><\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":1,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":73,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","05c6d4fb-7720-40f5-9b36-b00c0561acf1"],"settings":{"title":""}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"flex-start","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Do you manage to make time for yourself? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>My self-care time is the time I spend on the yoga mat.
