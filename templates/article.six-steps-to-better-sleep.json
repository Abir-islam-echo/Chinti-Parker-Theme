After all, how long has it been since you got a genuinely good night’s sleep? Technology, artificial light and our 24\/7 lifestyles have made it harder than ever for us to switch off at night. And with sleep being tied so closely to our overall health, so many of us pursue the perfect eight hours; but how do you turn that from a dream into reality? <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":50,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["60fc0c85-ddcf-4402-bba2-ac04477bc5ac","1663872094b49339eb-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1663868435f0c44a9a":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"1","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"#000000","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Improve lifestyle practices<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>So much of what we do during the day impacts how we wind down at night. In order to improve your sleep, first examine your daily lifestyle habits and see where you can make adjustments. Try to cut down on your coffee intake, limiting yourself to two or three caffeinated drinks per day. After midday, switch to decaf or try herbal tea instead. For the best sleep, avoid drinking alcohol right before you head to bed. Leave it at least two hours after your last glass of wine.  <br\/><br\/>Being sedentary all day can also harm your sleep. Try to be active every day by incorporating cardio into your routine - a 30 minute walk can make all the difference. Choose a light and healthy evening meal so it doesn’t sit heavy in your stomach as you try to drift off. Try to eat approximately three hours before you go to bed to allow plenty of time for digestion. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Six_steps_to_better_sleep_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"2","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Switch off <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Screens, specifically LED screens, contain blue light, and they can slow the production of melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone. Even the ‘Night’ or ‘Dark’ settings on your devices don’t reduce blue light completely. Going hours without screens isn’t practical in today’s world, but aim to be done with phones and laptops an hour before you begin your night time routine, and leave all electronics outside the bedroom if possible. <br\/><br\/>Make a habit of minimising your exposure to blue light before bed, and you’ll soon start to notice the benefits in how easily you fall asleep, and how well rested you feel in the morning. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Six_steps_to_better_sleep_3.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"3","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Wind down<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>With work, parenting and life admin to juggle, it’s hard for our evenings to not turn into a blur as we leap between tasks, before finally collapsing into bed. It’s no wonder restful sleep evades so many of us. Keep your evenings as relaxed as possible. Start by moving from a work mindset to a home mindset. This could be achieved by changing into more comfortable clothes - a loungewear set is perfect for off-duty dressing - and removing your makeup. From there, go about your evening tasks slowly and mindfully as you slow down ready for sleep. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Six_steps_to_better_sleep_4.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"4","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Take control of your emotions<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Strong emotions like stress, anxiety and frustration can have a profound impact on the quality of your sleep.

The ideal temperature for most adults is around 18 degrees Celsius; slightly cool with ventilation, if possible. While being on the warmer side may sound preferable, don’t forget that your bedding will heat you up while you sleep. If you decide your bed isn’t as comfortable as it should be, you could explore shopping for a new mattress or softer sheets.
