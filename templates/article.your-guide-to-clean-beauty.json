Terms such as “green”, “clean” and “natural” might sound great but are rather vague. “Chemical-free” is also a phrase that’s problematic, as all beauty ingredients can be defined as chemicals, regardless of whether they are natural or synthetic.  <br\/><br\/>Clean beauty may mean something different to each person, depending on their priorities. For one person, it could be vegan makeup that isn’t tested on animals, or for another, it could be skincare that’s free from sulphates, parabens and phthalates. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Your_guide_to_clean_beauty_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Where did it all begin? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>The wellness industry as a whole has been growing rapidly for the past few years.

Whether it’s our products or diets, clean and green are the driving factors behind the choices we make. We’re not only more conscious about what we eat and put in our bodies, but we’re also becoming far more aware of what we put on our skin.<\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Your_guide_to_clean_beauty_3.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Natural vs organic<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>“Natural” and “organic” are two words often heard alongside the clean beauty movement. However, they are not interchangeable. Natural means the ingredient was taken from plants. Organic means ingredients have been grown and processed without the aid of any chemicals, such as pesticides, herbicides, etc. Because of the additional steps organic products undertake, they tend to cost more to compensate. <br\/><br\/>As both these terms lack a specific definition and aren’t closely regulated, organic and natural are often used in “greenwashing”. Research companies that make these claims need to be sure that they are truly committed to lessening their environmental impact, as opposed to joining a trend and using buzzwords. <br\/><br\/>Without understanding the individual ingredients and their purpose, it can be hard to choose products based purely on their labels. For example, many natural ingredients need a preservative of some kind, such as parabens, to keep them stable and safe. Not every chemical is bad. <br\/><br\/>Avoid products that use terms such as “derived from”, as this suggests that the original, natural ingredient has undergone a process to turn it into something else. These processes can often result in a natural product’s healing properties becoming inactive. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Your_guide_to_clean_beauty_4.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>What about vegan products?<\/strong><\/em><strong> <\/strong><br\/><br\/>With veganism at its most popular, it’s no surprise that people want to sync their beauty regime with their diet and lifestyle.

It is estimated that the global beauty industry generates 120 billion units of packaging, with only 14% making it to the recycling centre. Opting for solid soap and shampoo bars or using refillables eliminates, or certainly reduces, plastic waste. If that’s not entirely possible, try brands that reduce their packaging (such as Glossier), use recycled packaging (such as REN), offer return and recycle schemes (such as The Body Shop, Kiehl’s, and Neal’s Yard), or only use glass or aluminium packaging (such as Sarah London). <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Your_guide_to_clean_beauty_6.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"0e350e92-8dc7-447c-ae4a-6ac4d056be03":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Your regime, your choice<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Clean beauty will look different to everyone.
