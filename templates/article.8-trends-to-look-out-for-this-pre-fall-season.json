More skin is exposed, brighter colours emerge, and the more pockets the better, it seems. Chinti & Parker explores eight trends to incorporate into your rotation this pre-fall. <br\/><br\/><strong>1. Precious cargo (pants)<\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>While a lack of pockets was once the bane of every woman’s wardrobe, pre-fall 2023 says no more. Handy pouches were aplenty on the runways this year, with multi-pocketed cargo pants touted as the must-wear item of the season. While the utilitarian look may not be your scene, there’s no denying that practicality is becoming a staple. <\/p>","text-color":"#080707","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/KJ218_SMS_FUSCIA_CROPPED_SWEATER_FUSCIA_E.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"84a75ef8-338e-43d8-8d0b-104c737af8c1":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":0,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>With 150+ species planted across their global sites, Treeapp prides itself on transparency via the online open source platform Restor.eco.<\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-1":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-0","template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-1"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","disabled":true,"settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Conscious Cashmere Collection","title_font_size":25,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["oatmeal-love-recycled-cashmere-sweater","navy-love-recycled-cashmere-sweater","blue-team-planet-recycled-cashmere-sweater","red-team-planet-recycled-cashmere-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}},"a17d4eda-58ef-4673-b93d-d39c5cab98ef":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":95,"title-margin-bottom":0,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><strong>2. Tailoring<br\/><\/strong><br\/>Bringing order back to our lives after a tumultuous start to the 2020s, tailoring is a way for us to find grounding. A suit - whether in the form of a blazer with trousers or pencil skirt - can help pull together a sharp look that adds structure and elegance simultaneously. Or if you want a tailored look that’s a little more dressed down, then a fitted blazer over a basic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/shirts-tops\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/shirts-tops\">tee<\/a> or sweater vest with straight-legged denim will have you looking pre-fall ready. <br\/><br\/><strong><br\/>3. Grunge revisited<\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>Distressed hems, flannel patterns and chunky, logger sweaters, it’s safe to say that 70s grunge is back - but in a neater sense, and with sleek blowouts. Reach for your favourite jeans, or possibly those with the ragged hems that have been hanging in your closet forever, and layer an oversized boyfriend shirt over your tee. But before you forego your shampoo and hairbrush for a few days, 2023 grunge remains polished; think smart heels, smooth hair, and carefully chosen jewellery. <br\/><br\/><\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/KPF2312_SMS_MULTI_COLOUR_T-SHIRT_MULTI_P_92709817-9987-4143-897f-212f3f9ce13e.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"08d1c264-c4c5-4ddf-8798-542c94df4674":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":0,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"37d60d6f-8af9-407f-a847-2bf891ad329e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":95,"title-margin-bottom":0,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><strong>4.

Denim of any kind <\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>Lovers of the high-waisted trend may shiver, but according to the runways, jean waistlines are coming way down. But don’t worry, denim in all shapes, sizes and colours are still a staple no matter the season. From printed, distressed, frayed, studded and in everything from coats to maxi skirts.  <br\/><br\/><strong>7. Ombré all the way<\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>Sunset prints were a prominent feature on the runways - so we’ve incorporated ombré tones into our pre-fall edit. Our unique take features an acid kiwi and fuschia blend on a cardigan that’s perfect for those late summer nights, layered over a pale maxi dress. For something more subtle, opt for a cream and pink gradient for a long summer’s day out. <br\/><br\/><strong>8. Vibrant coastal prints<\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>Can’t get to the beach? Bring the beach to your wardrobe instead with our abstract beach print tee and shorts. It’s the perfect look for summer parties, or when you want to be the boldest in the room. If you can make it to the beach, the bottoms make a perfect accompaniment piece with a bikini top and light sandals - which is perfect for those long walks on the sand. <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"edb2627a-ad48-481b-86ce-8bdf1b486b2b":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"5","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":95,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["template--14714843889742__5dcd7aab-3d3c-4af5-b811-3f2a39ba3230-1665676712ea04c99f-1","5c6a0e91-6803-40d9-8a8d-825a279b5c18","edb2627a-ad48-481b-86ce-8bdf1b486b2b"],"settings":{"title":""}},"ed69148b-9409-4774-b2b1-fdbcbf6a8e5b":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14714567458894__ed69148b-9409-4774-b2b1-fdbcbf6a8e5b-1666182962c9f7e109-0":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Talk about your brand","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>Use this text to share information about your brand with your customers.
