To be honest, working in the studio every day is pretty messy, so I tend to wear a rotation of jeans and jumpers. I am lucky enough to have a very good spread of Chinti Essentials which tends to do the trick (that is not a  plug, I have been a fan of the brand since they started and I really do buy at least one new ‘Essential’ sweater every season so I don’t have to worry about not having my literal uniform to hand. In the winter I will sometimes wear one on top of another.   <br\/> <br\/><br\/>After dropping the kids at school, I head straight to Highgate Ladies' Pond. I try not to miss a day. I am slightly one of those mad zealots with full neoprene kit. It is a proper routine involving a flask of sweet tea afterwards.  <br\/> <br\/>Then I head to my studio where I stay all day. I would say that my practice is centered around painting but heavily influenced by textiles. This isn’t surprising given I was a fashion designer for 15 years before doing my MA in Fine Art Painting at Slade School of Art in 2016. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"e954fbaf-15b3-4f27-909c-8aea021f19d4":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Group_2_a2c02967-9d36-4e25-8a03-1bc0b3981b28.png","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["b776a445-f2e8-4107-9637-9facfa177946","1663872094b49339eb-0","e954fbaf-15b3-4f27-909c-8aea021f19d4"],"settings":{"title":""}},"8a183ab4-9071-4318-8edb-84d6cc2ab920":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749842079822__8a183ab4-9071-4318-8edb-84d6cc2ab920-1685460384b06950de-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>It’s difficult to say when I started to define myself as an artist as I have always been a creative.  I think I prefer to define myself as a 'maker' as I have always made things. I did an art foundation course and for various reasons went on from there to study fashion at Central Saint Martins in the mid ‘90s. This was an amazingly creative time to work in fashion and the crossover to art wasn’t such a huge divide. Obviously running a fashion business is very different and the ‘art’ side got lost. I maintained my drawing and painting practice in a small way and eventually it grew until it took over my interest in fashion as a business.  <br\/><br\/>I really enjoy the total freedom I have in making my work within the boundaries of my choosing. I set the rules and decide when to break them. I also enjoy the very solitary nature of my days. People always ask if it is lonely, but I really enjoy the space and time to think and make without the distractions of other people around me.  <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":25,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"template--14749842079822__8a183ab4-9071-4318-8edb-84d6cc2ab920-1685460384b06950de-1":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749842079822__8a183ab4-9071-4318-8edb-84d6cc2ab920-1685460384b06950de-0","template--14749842079822__8a183ab4-9071-4318-8edb-84d6cc2ab920-1685460384b06950de-1"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1663868435f0c44a9a":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"#000000","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>Without wanting to sound smug, I have to say that I love my work. Of course, it is wonderful to be able to make money doing something I love, but to be honest I would do it anyway. I am very, very lucky and I really do try to acknowledge that all the time. Of course, it doesn’t always come easy and there are times of real frustration, insecurity, self-doubt and sometimes even despair, but those negatives are far outweighed by the highs (when they happen) of making good work and having the time and space to keep pushing myself forward. <br\/><br\/>The work \/ life balance doesn’t come easily to me.

As a parent to three kids of varying ages, I do need to come home and be present. I have started meditating for 15 minutes before leaving the studio. It doesn’t come very naturally and is a new thing I am trying but it does seem to help me to wind down. The evenings belong to the kids but once the little ones are in bed and no longer need me, I try to chill out with a book (old-school paper ones) or listen to Audible whilst sketching or weaving which I find very relaxing. <br\/> <br\/><br\/>My perfect Saturday would start under the premise that my kids are not doing all their various lessons and activities which frees me up from my normal obligations as an Uber driver.
