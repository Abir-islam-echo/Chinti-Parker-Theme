And even if we were willing to darn and stitch, the advent of fast fashion has paved the way for a throwaway culture. The continual enticement to buy new isn’t just damaging our finances, but also our planet. More than <a href=\"https:\/\/cleanclothes.org\/fashions-problems\/waste-and-pollution\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/cleanclothes.org\/fashions-problems\/waste-and-pollution\">100 billion items<\/a> of clothing are produced each year, and approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/california\/articles\/the-fashion-industry-waste-is-drastically-contributing-to-climate-change\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/pirg.org\/california\/articles\/the-fashion-industry-waste-is-drastically-contributing-to-climate-change\/\">85% <\/a>end up in landfill or burned. The world’s textile production produces global emissions equivalent to 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 every year. <br\/><br\/>The primary reason behind this consumption is how we as a society view our clothes. Currently they are disposable, easy to throw away, and cheap to replace. Changing this perspective won’t be easy, but it can be done, if we take steps to improve the relationship we have with our clothes.

Consider why you shop<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>There are many reasons why we shop - boredom, taking advantage of sales, even stress - but having the mindset of only shopping when there is a real need is important. Replacing garments that are damaged beyond repair, or acquiring an essential piece are perhaps the only two occasions where new clothes are required. Once you identify other motivators, you can start to change your mindset, and find a new way of viewing the clothes you already have. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_improve_your_relationship_with_your_clothes_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>2.

But instead of disregarding pieces that have been in your wardrobe for a while, why not learn to love them again? Think about how you could use different items to concoct an entirely new outfit, upcycling pieces to give them a new purpose. Spend some time reorganising your wardrobe to rediscover long-forgotten hidden gems that you can fall in love with again. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_improve_your_relationship_with_your_clothes_3.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>3. Be mindful during sales <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>The temptation for new clothes is always higher during sales periods. Boxing Day and January sales have always been a post-Christmas staple, but Black Friday has provided yet another excuse to shop. Fast fashion takes advantage of this by cutting their prices by 90% or even 100%, which perpetuates the throwaway culture that we currently have about our garments. <br\/><br\/>If you like to take advantage of sales, ask yourself “would I buy this at full price?” If the answer is no, then perhaps consider why you want to purchase it. Are you fulfilling some other need? Even by incorporating this act of mindfulness into your shopping will help to cut down unnecessary purchases, remember to ask yourself self-reflective questions every time you shop. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_improve_your_relationship_with_your_clothes_4.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>4. Consider sustainable investment pieces <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>There will be occasions when new pieces will be needed, especially when clothes become damaged beyond repair; and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/blogs\/journal\/were-all-about-cashmere\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/blogs\/journal\/were-all-about-cashmere\">shopping sustainably<\/a> is the ideal middle ground. Rather than opting for whatever is cheapest, alter your mindset to consider investing in pieces that may be more expensive, but that will last you for longer. For example, instead of a cheap polyester jumper, consider a sustainably and ethically made <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/100-cashmere\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/100-cashmere\">cashmere jumper<\/a> instead, or a higher quality, 100% cotton tee. Of course, this will save you money in the long term as you won’t need to replace as regularly, but sustainable retailers are more likely to have ethical and fair practices in place for those who make the clothing. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_improve_your_relationship_with_your_clothes_5.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"f82e9674-462e-405d-abe8-0768e14e9810":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>5. Wear smartly<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Not everyone can afford to shop for sustainable investment pieces, but the environmental problems from the fashion industry are partly caused by our throwaway culture. From drinks with friends to annual Christmas parties, so many of us shop for a brand new piece, only to never wear it again. Instead, try different accessories or shoes to wear old items in a whole new way. Apply this same mindset to all the clothes in your wardrobe, even those that you have previously bought from fast fashion retailers. Reframe your mind to show pieces extra love and care so they will last for years. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_improve_your_relationship_with_your_clothes_6.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"0e350e92-8dc7-447c-ae4a-6ac4d056be03":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>6.
