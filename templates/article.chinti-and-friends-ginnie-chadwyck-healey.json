And the way you dress from day to day? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>I had just had a baby when we began our first lockdown so naturally, I was more casual and focused on lower maintenance looks. But clothes definitely change my mindset from an okay day to a 'let's go for it' vibe so I employ colour to do that. Not necessarily bold colours, but great pairings. Green and pink, navy and tobacco, powder blue and army green. Most of all my clothes never get in the way of my routine. So, the shift to loungewear was very much welcomed but I always ensure I combine comfort with structure. Like a boyfriend jean with a blazer. Trainers and jeans but with a silk shirt. I could never do the whole daytime pyjama look! To be honest I knew, pre-Covid, that we could all live with far less. So, if anything this past year has only cemented my business strategy, which in some weird way I'm thankful for. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_-_Ginnie_Chadwyck-Healey_1.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>What would be your advice to others looking to make more sustainable choices when it comes to shopping for clothes? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>Read your labels!

So I can envisage wearing these pieces well into the autumn, even winter, with extra layers. I really have to ensure there is longevity to my wardrobe choices. It's about thinking 'Will I still love this after its first outing?' as we are all exposed to so much newness every single day, it can feel like we are constantly in need of something new. Really, I love the striped Jeanne top the most.
