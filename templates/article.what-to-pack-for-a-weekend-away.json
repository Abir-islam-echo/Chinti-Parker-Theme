Essential vacation shoes<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Shoes are the bane of easy packing. They’re bulky and unsuitably shaped, making them tricky to pop in a weekend bag. Stick with the shoes you’re going to need most - a pair of trainers or boots for exploring, heels for nights out, etc. - and plan your outfits around these. Picking a pair to travel in and another pair to pack may be your most efficient option when it comes to vacation shoes. <br\/><br\/>Once you’ve chosen your footwear, stuff it with underwear, socks, chargers and small beauty products.

How to organise your weekend bag <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>If you’re a person who thrives on organisation, you may already be familiar with this approach. Long weekend trips and staycations can often feel panicked or rushed, especially if you struggle to find certain key items in the depths of your suitcase. <br\/><br\/>The perfectly packaged bag will allow you to make the most of your time away. Try organising similar items into smaller bags or compartments - technology and chargers, jewellery, socks and underwear, T-shirts, etc. - to easily locate what you need in a hurry. Our reusable Chinti & Parker drawstring canvas bags will come in useful here.  <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Spring_clean_your_wardrobe_4.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"cc9e0833-6aa5-4e3f-a563-b41536c3fe06":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>5. How to pack efficiently<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>After sorting your clothes into smaller compartments, it’s time to pack efficiently. A tried-and-tested method for optimising storage and reducing wrinkles is rolling your clothes rather than folding them. Apply this technique to garments such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/knitwear\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/knitwear\">knitwear<\/a> cotton <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/shirts-tops\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/shirts-tops\">T-shirts<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/trousers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/trousers\">trousers<\/a>. This prevents wrinkles that may be difficult to remove when you’re away from home, and frees up room. <br\/><br\/>The exceptions to this are stiff fabrics which are better folded. Fragile or embellished garments should travel in their own garment bags, be laid flat during travel, and hung as soon as you get to your destination. If you’re staying for more than one night, take the time to unpack all your clothes upon arrival. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_pack_for_a_weekend_away_6.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"7139a3fd-8472-45f2-bbba-981c1b63a13e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>6. Have a bag for worn items<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Don’t forget about your return journey. Carry a spare tote that can be used to store your worn items throughout your trip.
