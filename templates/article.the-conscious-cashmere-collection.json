The other 3% is wool that allows the yarn to be spun effectively. On average, recycled cashmere uses 98% less water, 80% less electricity, 50% less chemicals, and creates 90% less CO2 emissions compared with non-recycled yarns.  <\/p><p>The entire collection is crafted in London, in a factory not far from our headquarters. This maintains a lower carbon footprint and supports garment production here in the UK. Another thoughtful – and zero-waste – consideration: the swing tags on each garment are made using seeded paper that, once planted, will grow into wildflowers.  <\/p><p>As with everything we produce, we hope that these sweaters are worn and cherished for a long time to come.
