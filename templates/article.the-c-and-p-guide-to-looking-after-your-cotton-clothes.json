This is so reflective of the women who go through our programme.

Over-drying can cause cotton to shrink and wrinkle so for kinder results, choose a lower temperature or a permanent press setting. More robust items such as sheets, towels and kitchen linens can be dried on higher temperatures to speed up the process. <br\/><br\/>We recommend air drying your cotton clothes on a drying rack, or when the weather is on your side, an outdoor clothesline. The sun's rays can help to brighten white cotton, although hang bright colours out of direct sunlight to prevent fading. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/The_C_P_guide_to_looking_after_your_cotton_clothes_9.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"d21d0c5f-7b79-4a9a-a2a1-521c57a634e5":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Step 5 - Ironing your cotton clothes<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>When dried properly, most cotton clothes will require minimal ironing. Some cotton fabrics can wrinkle or develop curled hems, which is when you may need to reach for the iron. Use a medium-hot temperature - or a specific cotton setting - and always iron on the underside of the fabric. For additional protection, place a pressing cloth between the fabric and the iron itself, especially if it’s a delicate or embellished item. <br\/><br\/>Avoid high temperatures, as this can lead to scorching or yellowing. <br\/><br\/>If you’re ironing shirts, obtain a crisp finish by misting with laundry starch while ironing. Or if you need a quick fix, try a clothes steamer or hang in a steamy bathroom while you shower.<\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/The_C_P_guide_to_looking_after_your_cotton_clothes_10.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--15486867570781__d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879-168562543036288bd1-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>How to store your cotton clothing<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Cotton is an incredibly durable fabric and can be worn day-to-day with ease. Once washed, dried and ironed, your only consideration when storing is to prevent wrinkling; fold or hang cotton pants in a dresser, and always hang cotton shirts. <br\/><br\/>Moths and moth larvae aren’t a concern when it comes to cotton, as they prefer animal fibres over vegetable-based fibres, a problem that more commonly arises with cashmere care. If you are storing 100% cotton items long-term, you will need to take steps to protect them against carpet beetles and their larvae. Natural repellents, such as cedar oil and cedar balls, work exceptionally well. <br\/><br\/>For short-term storage, airtight plastic containers will protect against carpet beetles. However, for long-term storage, opt for fabric storage containers, as the cotton needs to breathe. Then store in cool, dark and dry spaces. Avoid attics and basements, as the fluctuations in temperature and humidity can damage cotton. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Repairing your cotton<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Cotton is a very durable material, however, it can be prone to tears. Small rips can be repaired at home using a needle and thread. If you don’t have the time or necessary skills, a tailor or seamstress can perform more complex repairs. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>How to make your cotton clothes last longer <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>- Always wash cotton clothes inside out to prevent fading <br\/><br\/>- Don’t overload your machine to ensure all items are washed properly <br\/><br\/>- Some cotton, such as denim, should be washed infrequently to help maintain its shape, colour and quality <br\/><br\/>- Using fabric softener will help cotton clothes feel softer and  reduce wrinkling <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":50,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}},"template--15486867570781__d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879-168562543036288bd1-1":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A_guide_to_travel_skincare_10.jpg","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"f4b8a39c-e285-4b8e-a509-0386ddb86d96":{"type":"cta","settings":{"padding-top":20,"title":"Shop Dresses","url":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/dresses-skirts","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"cta_bg":"","cta_border_color":"","cta_border":1,"align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--15486867570781__d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879-168562543036288bd1-0","template--15486867570781__d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879-168562543036288bd1-1","f4b8a39c-e285-4b8e-a509-0386ddb86d96"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cotton-cashmere-polo-t-shirt","black-ribbed-cotton-cashmere-dress","blue-cotton-cashmere-dress","blue-cotton-cashmere-tank-top"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","1663868435f0c44a9a","ea1ee690-e3fb-4bda-8033-019456aff2db","16638720430f34827e","166387311379593d63","166387328793cd4683","166387221970bc3eb0","d21d0c5f-7b79-4a9a-a2a1-521c57a634e5","d5b6c93a-e0f9-4ab9-9fd8-aa945db21879","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
