Check its authenticity <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>If you do happen to come across a label during your search, a word of caution before you celebrate. Any item that boasts a name outside of an authorised retailer should be scrutinised until proven otherwise. Ask the staff for more information about the piece, such as where they got it and how long they’ve had it for? A quick internet search on your phone will reveal common counterfeit signs to look out for, which you can then compare to the piece in front of you. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_shop_vintage_6_105ade8f-8778-4917-ad8e-2d1fd7fe23f4.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"0e350e92-8dc7-447c-ae4a-6ac4d056be03":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>6. Study the care instructions<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Whether it’s designer or not, many vintage pieces come with specific care instructions, often dry-clean only. If the item really makes your heart sing, ask yourself if regular dry cleaning or complex care is something you want to keep up.  <br\/><br\/>Before you hand over your card, be sure to know what demands this new addition to your collection will be making. If it’s a special occasion piece, wonderful - this means that you won’t have to care for it regularly.

Don’t be tempted by every item that catches your eye; take some time to truly make sure it’s for you. Vintage shopping is a marathon, not a sprint, and it may take several trips to your favourite stores before you snap something up. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_shop_vintage_8.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14591016108134__b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b-1686142328a994a513-0":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Talk about your brand","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":25,"margin_top":30,"border_top":1,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"template--14591016108134__b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b-1686142328a994a513-1":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"a088c57c-ac2c-486a-adae-1cd9241f0b6d":{"type":"cta","settings":{"padding-top":24,"title":"Shop Essentials","url":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/cashmere-essentials","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"cta_bg":"","cta_border_color":"","cta_border":1,"align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14591016108134__b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b-1686142328a994a513-0","template--14591016108134__b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b-1686142328a994a513-1","a088c57c-ac2c-486a-adae-1cd9241f0b6d"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-crew-sweater","the-relaxed-polo-cashmere-black","the-slouchy-cashmere-black","black-cashmere-wide-leg-pants","bone-cashmere-slouchy-sweater","bone-cashmere-rollneck-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387328793cd4683","166387221970bc3eb0","f82e9674-462e-405d-abe8-0768e14e9810","0e350e92-8dc7-447c-ae4a-6ac4d056be03","ea1e4c24-fbc2-45ce-b91f-a1515d5f988e","b98148d7-cae6-42da-b04d-56e6e5daed1b","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
