I thought working from home would give me lots of spare time, but I feel like I have been busier than ever.  <br\/><br\/>How would you describe your working from home style? <br\/><br\/>My style is always evolving – but I would generally describe it as polished classics with a twist. <br\/><br\/>At the moment I’m in nesting mode so have been wearing lots of cosy knits, tracksuits and leggings. You can’t go wrong with soft cashmere and chic loungewear. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_-_Natalie_Salmon_1.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"1663872094552ff4cb":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"1663872094b49339eb-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>Whose personal style inspires you? <br\/><br\/>I have so many vintage references I keep looking back to which totally influence my style; Lee Radziwill, Marchesa Luisa Casati, and Bianca Jagger among them. I also love current French style icons, Caroline de Maigret and Carine Roitfeld.   <br\/><br\/>How are you spending your extra free time around the house? <br\/><br\/>I did a calligraphy course a couple of years ago and have really gotten back into it, I thought it would be a totally useless skill but there is something quite soothing about it. I bought a book called Calm Calligraphy and practice from that whenever I have a break from work. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["1663872094b49339eb-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"a2fea8e7-4f9d-4575-a736-fad925ef4cb8":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>What inspired you to start your website themodems.com? <br\/><br\/>I wanted a place to put all the information I’d learned about social media and share all of the tech updates for women that never get much coverage - for instance, chic smart watches and stories such as women using VR headsets during pregnancy. <br\/><br\/>Has technology changed the way you shop? <br\/><br\/>Absolutely, I shop online more than ever before and love the edits on sites such as Net-A-Porter. I also love that apps like Oprent and By Rotation have made it possible to borrow outfits for special occasions. <br\/><br\/>What do you think the future holds for fashion and technology? <br\/><br\/>I think the future is really exciting, there is so much happening with digital clothing offerings and VR where you will be able to try items on virtually – for instance, pointing your mobile phone at your feet to try on sneakers, or using your front camera to try on makeup before you buy it. A few brands already do this and it’s gaining a lot of traction in the US, I think it’s going to change the way we shop. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_-_Natalie_Salmon_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Natalie Recommends...","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><br\/>The one gadget you can’t live without? <br\/><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/uk\/watch\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/uk\/watch\/\">My Series 5 Apple watch<\/a>  <br\/><br\/>Home workout of choice? <br\/><br\/>The 7 Minute Workout app and online Bodyism classes. <br\/><br\/>Favourite shopping app? <br\/><br\/>I was devastated when Polyvore shut down as that was my favourite.
