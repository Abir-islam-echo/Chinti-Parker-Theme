Riley began to experiment with optical illusions, and by the early ‘60s, she was creating the clean-lined geometric paintings for which she is now known. Her affinity for colour and pattern is one the Chinti & Parker team can wholeheartedly relate to.  <br\/><\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-1","e7cef744-fdbb-455d-a14d-8f7673bf3293","template--14685385359438__bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e-1665588718d99615f4-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"b2106021-4cfb-42d5-b8d7-3c7c823a7278":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"1663868435f0c44a9a":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"ART MEETS FASHION","grid-title-font-size":23,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"#000000","content-alignment":"flex-start","grid-content":"<p><br\/>Riley’s op art inspired our design team to go about painting a selection of their own eye- teasing patterns.
