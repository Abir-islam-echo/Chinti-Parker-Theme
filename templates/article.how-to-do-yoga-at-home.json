Where can you practise yoga at home? <br\/><br\/>The beauty of yoga is that there is no perfect setting. In an ideal world, your environment shouldn’t deter what you take away from your practice; of course, this is easier said than done, but it’s a goal to keep in mind. If possible, choose a space that is free of distractions and clutter. Set the mood as much as possible, whether that’s through translucent blinds at the window, dim lights, burning incense or a candle. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_practise_yoga_at_home_3_09604ada-3751-4894-9e69-159538e49f34.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>3. What can I wear to do yoga at home? <br\/><br\/>Flexible clothing is ideal for yoga, ones that won’t restrict your movement. Comfort is especially important for an at-home practice, but don’t let an ill-fitting pair of trousers hinder your flexibility. Many budding yogis opt for leggings and a loose T-shirt, or a super comfortable tracksuit for a seamless transition between downtime and that day’s practice.<\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_practise_yoga_at_home_4_d2ab34f0-ae4c-436c-8326-869f08ec2172.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"cc9e0833-6aa5-4e3f-a563-b41536c3fe06":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>4. How much time do I need to practise? <br\/><br\/>The beauty of the at-home yoga practice is that you can structure your “classes” around your own life. Whilst studio classes can range from one hour to 90 minutes in length, many yoga teachers will insist that no effort is too short. Whether you have six or 60 minutes to spare, there are always rewards to be reaped.  <br\/><br\/>Slot your practice into your life. If you work from home you may prefer to indulge in a morning flow before the working day begins. Or if you have young children, a relaxing evening stretch after bath and bed might suit your schedule better. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/How_to_practise_yoga_at_home_5_6b28cd36-e28b-490d-be44-8279c7873c23.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"7139a3fd-8472-45f2-bbba-981c1b63a13e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>5.
