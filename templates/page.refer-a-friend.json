When we first started the brand in 2009, we weren’t excited by the existing cashmere offering – most sweaters were very traditional and only available in limited colours. That’s why we decided to take this <strong>superlatively soft<\/strong> yarn and use it to create contemporary, fun and <strong>feel good<\/strong> designs that would stand out from the crowd.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Always experimenting with <strong>colour, texture<\/strong> and motifs via intricate <strong>intarsia<\/strong>, innovative knit techniques and flattering shapes, our love affair with cashmere continues to this day. Read on to learn a little about what makes this yarn so precious and why we love working with it so much. <\/p>","section-one-title":"What is cashmere?","section-one-paragraph":"<p>Known for being one of the softest fibres in the world, cashmere is synonymous with luxury and is core to Chinti & Parker’s brand DNA.<\/p>","section-one-link":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/cashmere-essentials","section-one-link-title":"Shop cashmere essentials","section-one-image-1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5eea04dd7826495766c6e8c4.jpg","section-one-image-2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5fc7c5d0705c693a048ae2b2.jpg","section-one-image-3":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5f22ab6f705c6970cbed5c91.jpg","section-two-title":"Where does cashmere come from?","section-two-paragraph":"<p>Our cashmere comes from the Capra hircus goat in Mongolia in Northern China where our suppliers have excellent relationships with the goat herders who breed the animals. These goats have a fleece which consists of two layers; the top one is coarse and wiry, and the other is a super-soft undercoat, otherwise known as cashmere. Cashmere creates an insulating layer to help the goats survive extreme weather conditions, through harsh cold winters and torrid heat waves.<\/p>","section-two-title-extra":"Did you know?","section-two-text-extra":"10% of our knitwear offering is made locally in London.","section-two-link-extra":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/all-clothing","section-two-link-title-extra":"Shop made in London","section-two-image-1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5ee9eb11705c6943ff55905d.jpg","section-two-image-text":"Our suppliers have excellent relationships with the goat herders.","section-two-image-2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5ee9eb127826495766c6db80.jpg","section-three-title":"How is cashmere harvested and processed?","section-three-image-content-1":"Compared to shearing, hand combing goats is cruelty free.","section-three-image-1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5ef09215705c6975ddc12c70.jpg","section-three-paragraph-1":"Once every spring, when the climate is milder and the goats naturally shed their coats, the goat herders harvest the delicate under-fleece by gently combing the goat, without causing any harm to the animal. The precious fibres of the goat’s warming undercoat are separated from the protective topcoat during a labour-intensive task that involves combing and sorting the hairs by hand.","section-three-image-2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/5eeb89ab705c6975ddbf3d0b.jpg","section-three-paragraph-2":"The bundles of fibres are then transported to a laboratory to undergo the first phase of quality analysis.
