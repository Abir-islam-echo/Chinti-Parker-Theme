Establish what you’d like to keep or part with, being as strict as you can with the selection process and organising items into piles. Consider how often you’ve worn individual pieces, and whether you’re likely to wear them in the future. Do they represent your current aesthetic, or hold sentimental value? If not, it may be time for a refresh. Good quality clothes you no longer want can be sold, gifted or donated to prevent them going to waste. Complete this process regularly to keep on top of your collection <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Step 2: discover your aesthetic<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Before adding new pieces to your wardrobe, consider your ideal aesthetic. For example, perhaps you’d like to try different colours and patterns. Pinterest is perfect for this, and creating a mood board will help with understanding how best to match items, alongside allowing you to discover alternative ways to wear staple pieces. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Step 3: invest in high-quality pieces <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Curating a minimalist wardrobe is all about investing in high-quality items that are designed to last. This is vital for maintaining a sustainable lifestyle, and it will reduce costs in the long run. Think carefully before making purchases, considering which occasions you’ll wear them for, and whether they can be worn in a multitude of ways. Doing this will ensure that you’re getting the most out of your minimalist wardrobe. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Step 4: care for your clothes correctly<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Alongside purchasing high-quality clothes, caring for them correctly will ensure their longevity. For example, delicates such as cashmere will last for decades when they’re washed and stored correctly. As a general rule, always check the label beforehand to establish how best to care for the fabric to avoid accidental damage.  <br\/><br\/>For more advice on how to care for your cashmere, refer back to the complete Chinti & Parker guide.  <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Step 5: keep your wardrobe organised<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Maintaining wardrobe organisation is key for effortless, minimalist style. This will make curating outfits much easier, and ridding your life of chaos - whether that be clothing-related or otherwise - will contribute to a clearer mind. Separate items by colour or design, placing them into piles before storing them back in your wardrobe. Remember that certain pieces, such as cashmere, will need to be folded rather than hung to prevent them losing their shape. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":25,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["9089640b-9575-49d7-a5f0-c4a6fd6c6d86","1663872094b49339eb-0","3fe759de-de47-4c35-81ac-4e427eb39355","2a69eae2-8724-4054-99d1-d0f39f1ceeff"],"settings":{"title":""}},"0c0befc1-2526-47ff-80a1-9958b6e45543":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"What advice would you give to someone in a creative rut?","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em>You can’t force it. It’s really difficult to always remain your most creative when it’s your job and you need to channel it constantly, whilst also picking up on the unavoidable day to day aspects that are less creative, and more admin based. You are constantly switching your brain from one thing to the other. Because I work in fashion, if I want to be inspired, I have to step away from it. My advice is to read a book, see an exhibition, watch an inspiring film or just get out of your routine and have a change of scenery. As a designer, there are always times when you don’t know how you are going to find the inspiration for the next season, but it always comes together in the end.<\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"What words do you live by?","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em>Treat others as you would like to be treated.<\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"502bae48-b9ec-4f8a-a860-1b988a5edcc8":{"type":"cta","settings":{"title":"Shop Essentials","url":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"cta_bg":"","cta_border_color":"","cta_border":1,"align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae","502bae48-b9ec-4f8a-a860-1b988a5edcc8"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-boxy-sweater","black-cashmere-crew-sweater","the-relaxed-polo-cashmere-black","black-wool-cashmere-wide-leg-track-pants","bone-cashmere-boxy-sweater","bone-cashmere-cropped-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","0c0befc1-2526-47ff-80a1-9958b6e45543","166387311379593d63","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
