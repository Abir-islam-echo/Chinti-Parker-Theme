I love how French women wear their clothes and hate feeling too dressed up or wearing too much make up. I find that wearing men’s or oversized clothes makes me feel the sexiest. I love a boilersuit layered with an oversized coat and my trusty Converse (I’ve worn them for the last 15 years) or an oversized suit with a pair of Nike trainers. I can’t bear to wear really high heels throughout the day as I’m running around all the time and jumping on and off the tube. In the summer and on holiday I’m all about colour and I collect kaftans, this also means I don’t stress about losing extra pounds before the beach as I just spend the whole time wafting around in beautiful kimonos. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":20,"padding_bottom":20,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["2ab7a0d8-3466-497f-b547-b7ffbdfc30fb","1663872094b49339eb-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1663868435f0c44a9a":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"#000000","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Does your look change much for work vs. the weekend? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>When I’m running around with my son I opt for comfort, so there’s nothing better than wearing a beautiful cashmere tracksuit at the weekend and not having to wear make-up.

I think my style is pretty high-low, so if my skirt is short, I’ll wear something looser on top or if my hair is scraped back, I’ll add some giant earrings. I love colour and it makes me very happy, especially jewel and pastel colours, I like to layer them tone on tone. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_Priya_De_Souza_3.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>How do you express your personality through what you wear? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>My style is a big part of my identity and I’ve been obsessed with fashion since I was a child, I could literally shop for days and I’m not scared to make bold choices. That being said, I don’t overthink what I wear, and it takes me 20 minutes max to get ready. So many people influence my style, my fashion heroes vary from the Olsen twins to Alexa Chung to Instagram style mavens like Clara Berry and Pernille Teisbaek. <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Priya's Picks<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>I love the bright pink of this Luxury jumper on my skin tone and it instantly picked up my mood. It’s such a cosy jumper and just the right shade of pink. What’s odd is for so many years I hated pink and now half my wardrobe is pink. I’m like 50 shades of pink. <br\/><br\/>I love a bit of glitter, so I was drawn to this sparkly jumpsuit. Also, the wrap front is so flattering. I’d wear it with Converse during the day to tone it down and then switch to a pair of metallic boots for a special occasion. <br\/><br\/>These pink trousers are honestly the most flattering, leg lengthening trousers I’ve ever worn. I’d wear them with a white t-shirt or grey sweater and Converse during the day and then with a little ankle boot for post-work drinks. I never want to take them off.<\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"63124947-b938-4db1-87fd-9ec9864ba757":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_Priya_De_Souza_4.jpg","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"28bcea06-2011-4f4b-991d-178b57b943c9":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_Priya_De_Souza_5.jpg","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}},"74110c40-4458-454f-852b-6ad60e73b3e6":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Style_Insider_Priya_De_Souza_6.jpg","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","63124947-b938-4db1-87fd-9ec9864ba757","28bcea06-2011-4f4b-991d-178b57b943c9","74110c40-4458-454f-852b-6ad60e73b3e6"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-crew-sweater","black-ribbed-cotton-cashmere-dress","blue-cotton-cashmere-dress","orange-ribbed-cotton-cashmere-dress","bright-coral-wool-cashmere-slouchy-scoop-sweater","bubblegum-wool-cashmere-boxy-hoodie"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387311379593d63","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
