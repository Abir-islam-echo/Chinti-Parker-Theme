And what influences it? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>I have many styles, I change my look depending on where I am… In Marrakech I wear caftans. In London it’s very much ‘jeans and a white shirt’ in the day and an LBD in the evening. I am more eccentric in London though than in Paris, say, where everything is more subdued. At home I am always cosy, choosing comfortable but stylish clothes. I love cashmere as I am very sensitive to touch. I think we need to feel the energies of the place we are in and very importantly the energies of ourselves when we get dressed each day. For example, I might ask myself, do I need to express exuberance or be more introvert and protected today? <br\/><br\/><em><strong>With most of us spending a lot more time at home, have you adapted how you dress in the last year – if so, how?    <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>For sure. The cosy factor is now first on the list. I’m choosing lots of soft fabrics and fluid shapes – except for when it comes to gym gear. Lots of cotton, cashmere and feel good, natural materials. Caftans, track suits, loose pants and big cardigans... <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Karen_Ruimy_1.jpg","image-caption":"Karen wears the mango cashmere v-neck sweater","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"flex-start","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>What are you most looking forward to wearing once lockdown lifts – and where?   <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>A nice sexy dress that reminds me I have that in me too!

The pandemic is not a normal moment. It has made us like cave animals, we start to believe we are fine inside and that the world outside is not friendly. But actually, the minute you get be out and start exchanging with another being you will feel such a relief. We are here to exchange, to feel each other’s energies, to share our lives. We are missing it but, at the same time, retreating into a cave has built up false fears of being in a foreign world.<\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Karen_Ruimy_2_6ce071af-e5e1-48a0-81ce-2f9472a2316f.jpg","image-caption":"Karen wears the lilac v-neck cashmere sweater","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>Find out more at <a href=\"https:\/\/kalmarlifestyle.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/kalmarlifestyle.com\/\">kalmarlifestyle.com<\/a><\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-boxy-sweater","black-cashmere-comfort-sweater","black-cashmere-crew-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","4ad22125-9ad2-4f93-9730-0a6e35dfa440","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387328793cd4683","166387221970bc3eb0","166387311379593d63","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
