My husband makes me eggs on toast for breakfast which we will have with some Climpson’s coffee; it’s our morning ritual. My getting ready process is speedy: get up, chuck some clothes on, put a red lip on and get out the door. I walk to work, our office is only 20 minutes away and I aim to get in between 8am and 8.30am. On my way into the office I like to call my Mum, Dad and Grandma at home in Australia before picking up an oat flat white from Caravan in Fitzrovia. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":0,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["1a5462b6-c932-4923-9e91-45aecba4fa63","1663872094b49339eb-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1663868435f0c44a9a":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"#000000","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>I work for the e-commerce platform Shopify Plus as Head of Marketing for EMEA, so my job involves looking at how we can expand into new markets, what our various customers need and how we can help them to optimise their offering.

I sync with our Canadian office, so they’ll come online at 2pm and we’ll have the afternoon together which works well because I get the morning to myself then the rest of the day with them. <\/p>","text-color":"#000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_Anna_Bray_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387311379593d63":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"16638731131a5bdc7d-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>One of the many great things about working for Shopify is that the company encourages you to be entrepreneurial and have a business on the side, which has obviously been great for making my art. I have been painting and drawing for as long as I can remember but it became a bit more of a thing when friends started asking me to do little commissions as birthday, wedding or anniversary presents.

Every couple of months me and my husband will hold a supper club in the studio, which is a great way to get people together and a nice way to share the stuff that I’m doing. It can sometimes feel a bit awkward to self-promote on Instagram but having the pieces hung in that space while people enjoy a lovely home-cooked meal and a glass of wine is a non-aggressive way to show what I’m doing. We end up meeting really nice people as well. In fact, it reaffirms my faith a bit because everyone is always so curious and friendly. I always end the evening remembering why I love living here.   <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","c51952c1-ca8d-4e18-b7b1-f0cb2e8c7653","4399e26e-3b51-478f-a383-28d8e9764254"],"settings":{"title":""}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>I got the idea for hosting supper clubs when I was living in Paris with one of my best friends from Sydney. There were loads of them in Paris. Unfortunately, we never got it off the ground in Australia, however, when I moved into this house in London, I thought the space was perfect. We decorate with fairy lights and candles and do the table nicely.  My husband and I cook all the food. A menu might consist of something like shaved pickled beetroot with burrata and nuts to start, followed by white fish with a nutty breadcrumb served with beetroot puree and miso vegetables, then a pavlova for dessert. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_Anna_Bray_5.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p>I’m such a creature of habit and love spending time at home.

There’s always so much going on in London, I find it’s hard to fit it all in. <br\/> <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_Anna_Bray_6.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"0a6af4f4-8360-4776-825d-2a170b0958c3":{"type":"custom-content","blocks":{"template--14749841686606__0a6af4f4-8360-4776-825d-2a170b0958c3-16855301035529c80a-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Group_6_9d1d725a-b01b-4fca-91c9-d61945eafd90.png","width":"100%","alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749841686606__0a6af4f4-8360-4776-825d-2a170b0958c3-16855301035529c80a-1"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["blue-silk-cashmere-vest","blue-silk-cashmere-polo-top","sand-silk-cashmere-t-shirt","sand-silk-cashmere-vest","raspberry-silk-cashmere-polo-top","raspberry-silk-cashmere-t-shirt"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","1663868435f0c44a9a","166387311379593d63","16638720430f34827e","166387328793cd4683","0a6af4f4-8360-4776-825d-2a170b0958c3","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
