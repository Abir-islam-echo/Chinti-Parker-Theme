We both loved to cook and entertain, and opposite Julie’s was sitting an empty shop. After a glass of wine, the thought hit both of us… “Let’s open a kitchen shop”. The idea was to create a space which had a kind of purity. Everything should be practical, but also beautiful, and connect with the kitchen… nothing needed to be hidden away – pots and pans, brushes, ceramics, should all be things of beauty, to enhance the kitchen space. <br\/><br\/><strong>How would you describe the Summerill & Bishop DNA?<\/strong> <br\/>Contemporary and creative, with a twist. <br\/><br\/><strong>What is your current favourite way to style an outdoor dining table?<\/strong> <br\/>A simple cloth dressed with a small branch of a tree, or some twigs from the garden. I would place bud vases intermittently between the twigs, bearing simple flowers and ferns. On each folded napkin I would place a leaf. I always use my S&B Clair glasses to add jewel like colour to the simple scheme and my assorted wine glasses, collected over the 26 years of S&B. <br\/><br\/><\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Parker_meets_Summerill_Bishop_4.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"cf190413-3391-40a2-a0d8-98e8db513336":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"cffbe767-a6bd-49cb-9186-e4dc51fc3e01":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"d506498f-bf5e-4fee-9d16-482488141454":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><strong>For people without a garden, how would you recommend bringing a feeling of the outdoors inside during the warmer months? <\/strong><br\/>Use a lot of green…the freshest colour. Bring the outside in, with ferns and flowers in vases, plus pots with plants – all of which look beautiful on the table. To finish, burn candles with a fresh scent and get the music right; a bit of light Mozart - in the flute and harp concerto you can almost hear the birds singing. <br\/><br\/><br\/><strong>Do you have a signature springtime menu you like to serve?<\/strong> <br\/>I would start with layers of grilled peppers, sprinkled with garlic, olive oil and basil andtopped with salted anchovies. It’s a River Café special. To follow would be risotto with asparagus and peas and then panna cotta with berries to finish. <br\/><br\/><strong>How does setting the table beautifully help to bring some joy to mealtimes during this period of lockdown? <br\/><\/strong>It’s a lovely creative thing, trying to do something a little different for each meal. Making the table interesting and compatible with the food creates a feeling of optimism, which we all need at this time. I always have music playing whilst doing this, which just lifts me even further. Sometimes I tie a napkin with string, herbs and leaves, scatter petals, or use a beautiful handmade napkin ring. A switch of flowers and glasses and a different tablecloth or placemat all creates a feeling of freshness and change. Both things we need a lot of at the moment. <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["d506498f-bf5e-4fee-9d16-482488141454"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-boxy-sweater","black-cashmere-comfort-sweater","black-cashmere-crew-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","166387311379593d63","dfacdc63-2a3b-4636-9849-13a266003e6a","1663868435f0c44a9a","cf190413-3391-40a2-a0d8-98e8db513336","cffbe767-a6bd-49cb-9186-e4dc51fc3e01","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
