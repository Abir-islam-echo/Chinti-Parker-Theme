One of the world’s finest and most delicate natural fibres, your cashmere pieces will last for decades if well cared for. Ensure you wash your knits every 3-4 wears, even if they aren't visibly stained, as moths will flock to pieces that have any remnant of debris.  <br\/><br\/>We show you how, below… <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"1663748669fcb947ae-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"How to wash your cashmere clothing","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>When it comes to washing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/all-cashmere\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">cashmere<\/span><\/a>, you have two options: by hand or in the machine. Machine washing is our co-founder Rachael’s favourite method. She says, “I swear by machine washing my knits. It’s an environmentally friendly alternative to dry cleaning and great if you’re too time-poor – or too lazy – for hand washing.” Machine washing is most suitable for lighter gauges, rather than your chunky knits. If you are opting to wash your cashmere in the machine, we suggest using the delicate or woollens cycle, selecting the lowest-speed spin setting and a cold temperature. We recommend using a gentle detergent developed especially for knitwear. If in doubt, then washing your knits by hand is a failsafe option.
