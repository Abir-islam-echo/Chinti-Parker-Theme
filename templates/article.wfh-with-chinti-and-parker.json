I’ve got a candle at one end, which adds to the stress-free ambience I try to create. At the moment I have a temporary desk, so I try and make it feel as inviting and homely as I can. My working from home outfit is a black Chinti & Parker Essentials tracksuit and Birkenstocks. It also transitions into my home-schooling attire. <br\/><br\/>My advice to others who are working from home would be to make sure you take an hour away from your desk to exercise, meditate or do whatever relaxes you each day. By taking some time for yourself, it really helps to clear your mind and makes you feel like you can tackle the rest of the day. <br\/><br\/>In order to stay productive, I like to step away from my desk and have a walk around or just take a moment to myself in different surroundings and perhaps get some fresh air. It’s very easy, especially during the times we find ourselves in, to just stay inside all day and not walk away from work. At the end of the workday, a very big glass of red wine is a must! <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Working_from_home_with_Chinti_Parker_1.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"4bf57ce3-e2be-4818-9876-1a928e9d1f12":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749843816526__4bf57ce3-e2be-4818-9876-1a928e9d1f12-1684847368c1762bcf-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>''Make sure you take an hour away from your desk to exercise, meditate or do whatever relaxes you each day.''<\/strong><\/em> <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":25,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749843816526__4bf57ce3-e2be-4818-9876-1a928e9d1f12-1684847368c1762bcf-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"d21038ed-6807-4c4e-96cd-0b28e89d333d":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Julia Andersson, US Sales Manager <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>I work in the living room, my favourite room in the house where we have a bright wall of bookshelves. Ironically, my personal style is relatively neutral in colour, but I love a colourful home and our book wall is certainly that. I like to wear my favourite soft denim with Chinti & Parker Essentials cashmere; I live in the oatmeal roll neck these days. I sit myself next to our Marshall speakers, as the resident DJ I need easy access. <br\/><br\/>I’ve kept the habit of setting an alarm for 6.30am and getting up as I would if I had to commute to the office. I usually do something to move my body in the morning; yoga, stretching, or a short circuit. I’ll then hydrate with fresh lemon water and a matcha green tea latte. I never used to take a lunch break at the office but now we take a walk at lunch time to get out of the house and get some much-needed fresh air. <br\/><br\/>When it comes to switching off, my local yoga studio has been fantastic in offering their usual schedule online, so I have plenty of flows to choose from for the evening. I’ve also got back into cooking and enjoy experimenting in the kitchen (my fiancé seems to enjoy it too!).<\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Working_from_home_with_Chinti_Parker_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"7c00e89a-b18b-4bbb-b3cd-3803ca27c67f":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749843816526__7c00e89a-b18b-4bbb-b3cd-3803ca27c67f-1684847368c1762bcf-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>\"I sit myself next to our Marshall speakers, as the resident DJ I need easy access.'' <\/strong><\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749843816526__7c00e89a-b18b-4bbb-b3cd-3803ca27c67f-1684847368c1762bcf-0"],"settings":{"title":""}},"deda3492-efad-4836-b046-11039c8aafc7":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"166387328793cd4683":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"flex-start","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>Francesca Sieler, Marketing Director<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Since working from home, I have taken over what used to predominantly be my husband’s space.
