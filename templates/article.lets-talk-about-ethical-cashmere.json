Here at Chinti & Parker, our cashmere comes from the Capra hircus goat in Mongolia, Northern China. The goats that produce these fibres have a fleece with two layers; the top is wiry and coarse, and the undercoat is super soft. This is the cashmere, and it acts as an insulating layer to help the goats survive extremely cold weather conditions. <br\/><br\/>Our cashmere supplier is based in Inner Mongolia, where they have a fantastic relationship with the goat herders who breed the animals. They also work on a ‘vertical model’, which means that the entire process, from start to finish, is handled by the same supplier. You can read more about our supply chain here. <br\/><br\/>As temperatures start to rise after winter, the goats shed their coats naturally. This is when our suppliers will comb out the fine hair gently - without harming the goats - and separate the two coats by hand.  <br\/><br\/>The harvested fibres are sent to a laboratory to be examined where their quality is determined. If the quality is deemed high enough, they will be spun into cashmere in mills. <br\/><\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/lets_talk_about_cashmere_5.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"6bf2817a-5da2-4571-b375-a7623a3165aa":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"08d1c264-c4c5-4ddf-8798-542c94df4674":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":10,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"5dcd7aab-3d3c-4af5-b811-3f2a39ba3230":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"5c6a0e91-6803-40d9-8a8d-825a279b5c18":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":95,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>Just as the archipelago is famed for its laid-back attitude, our PF23 collection invites its wearer to embrace slow living.

Because of this, cashmere was deemed an expensive luxury, something that was cared for and passed on in the family.  <br\/><br\/>The negative effects of fast fashion on the environment are well-documented, as are the ethical implications. And unfortunately, the impact of fast fashion has started to spread into the cashmere industry, where it’s not uncommon to find cashmere products such as scarves and gloves at lower prices than they should be. <br\/><br\/>There are a number of factors that contribute to cashmere being deemed ethical. This includes the goats being well cared for, wool harvested at the correct time of year, demand for cashmere kept low enough as to reduce the environmental impact from farming, and workers paid fairly and given good working conditions. If these are all met to a high standard, there is no reason why cashmere cannot be an ethical material <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["template--14714843889742__c89eb819-94f6-4207-91b7-67fc564ecf0a-1665741081f88cdfa4-1","83bfd406-1ead-4fc6-9fdc-3ae8176cdae4"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1cdc673b-6f7a-43d7-9841-1bc0c32810ce":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"df582223-efca-495e-a2ec-f121951655fd":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><strong>How can I be sure my cashmere is ethical?<\/strong><\/p><p><br\/>As with most products, cheap luxury products are usually too good to be true. If something is sold at less than it is worth, that often means a step has gone awry during production. This could be mistreatment of the animal providing the material, or the workers who create the garments. <br\/><br\/>Always research the brand you are buying from before purchasing. Look for transparency in their supply chains; does the brand provide clear information about where their fabric is sourced and how it is handled from start to finish? Any cashmere brand worth their money will be eager to present this information prominently.  <br\/><br\/>High-quality cashmere products are an investment and should feel as such. Cashmere should be cared for and stored properly, so that it will last for years to come, and can even be passed on to the next generation. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/lets_talk_about_cashmere_4.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"3894bfaf-e873-46df-be9c-43d9f0cfca45":{"type":"featured-blog","settings":{"title":"Blog posts","blog":"journal","post_limit":"4"}}},"order":["blog-title","11aa5687-819f-40a1-85a5-7a593ba7b757","84a75ef8-338e-43d8-8d0b-104c737af8c1","bd998f9c-cda2-4e38-9522-dc6335ac521e","ff492aee-32e2-40dc-91d9-43602c1d8ea1","853c211e-756a-4019-bc97-3e7312225f29","8af4d155-e197-4b28-a895-5d7b08f9e588","a6310e91-d2d5-444f-8a00-370fa90d1605","6bf2817a-5da2-4571-b375-a7623a3165aa","08d1c264-c4c5-4ddf-8798-542c94df4674","5dcd7aab-3d3c-4af5-b811-3f2a39ba3230","c89eb819-94f6-4207-91b7-67fc564ecf0a","1cdc673b-6f7a-43d7-9841-1bc0c32810ce","df582223-efca-495e-a2ec-f121951655fd","3894bfaf-e873-46df-be9c-43d9f0cfca45"]}
