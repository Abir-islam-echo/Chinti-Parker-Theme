You may choose to French tuck a striped top or flowy shirt into a midi skirt, using a blazer or leather jacket to drape over your shoulders during cooler months. Irrespective of the season or the occasion, layering is made simple with stripes. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Six_ways_to_wear_stripes_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>2.

Rather than blending subtle patterns in with the rest of your ensemble, make your magnificent stripes the sole focus with thick lines and bright, dominant colours, paired with minimalist accessories. Experimentation is key here; whether you choose to wear a striped two-piece, or perhaps you’ve got your eye on a singular, statement garment, the choice is yours to make. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Six_ways_to_wear_stripes_4.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>4.

Although it is possible to pair stripes with stripes - broken up by vertical and horizontal styles - it’s important to give the eye a break.
