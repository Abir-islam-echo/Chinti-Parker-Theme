It’s really difficult to always remain your most creative when it’s your job and you need to channel it constantly, whilst also picking up on the unavoidable day to day aspects that are less creative, and more admin based. You are constantly switching your brain from one thing to the other. Because I work in fashion, if I want to be inspired, I have to step away from it. My advice is to read a book, see an exhibition, watch an inspiring film or just get out of your routine and have a change of scenery. As a designer, there are always times when you don’t know how you are going to find the inspiration for the next season, but it always comes together in the end.<\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"What words do you live by?","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em>Treat others as you would like to be treated.<\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}}},"block_order":["16638731131a5bdc7d-0","11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-cashmere-boxy-sweater","black-cashmere-comfort-sweater","black-cashmere-crew-sweater"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","2db26987-19f2-4b02-b8b1-224d1cfff19b","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387328793cd4683","166387221970bc3eb0","166387311379593d63","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
