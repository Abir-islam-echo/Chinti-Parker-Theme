At the beginning, it was hard to look at fashion as something vital, but as time has gone on I have thought about how it has always provided a type of escapism, whether it’s buying a dress for a holiday that you’re hoping to go on soon enough, or a pair of new slippers that make you feel more pulled together at home. These are things that help the mind as well and that is what is so important right now. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Friends_-_Laura_Fantacci_1.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"1663872094552ff4cb":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"1663872094b49339eb-0":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"What’s the best thing about being design director at Chinti & Parker?","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em>I love working in a female founded, female director led company.

When that is taken away, and you are just doing it for yourself, it is a very interesting exercise.

My advice is to read a book, see an exhibition, watch an inspiring film or just get out of your routine and have a change of scenery. As a designer, there are always times when you don’t know how you are going to find the inspiration for the next season, but it always comes together in the end.<\/em><\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":0,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"11c8e680-faf8-4b93-baed-a029ff63ebae":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":20,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>How else have you kept some routine in your days? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>I have had to rethink my routine a little to put me and my wellbeing at the centre of it.

In the morning, things have remained virtually unchanged, I spend some time getting ready, simply washing and moisturising my face, doing my hair and then getting dressed. I will have breakfast with the kids, and then the working day begins. I always stop for a nice healthy lunch; I think it is important that we take that time off.

The breathing and the asanas really help me to unwind. My working days are quite full on, and trying to make sure I come out of this period with the business intact is a huge responsibility, so taking that time for myself in the evening is important. After yoga, I lock myself in the bathroom, take a shower and maybe do a body scrub or put a mask on. We then cook dinner from scratch every evening; I like to lay the table nicely and really make an effort. I try not to work after dinner, and I don’t watch television as I prefer to go to bed with a good book.   <br\/><br\/>On a Friday evening I pretty much switch off from work except for overseeing our social channels.
