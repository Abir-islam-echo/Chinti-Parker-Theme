A simple eco-friendly habit to adopt is to try and avoid synthetic fibres wherever you can, and only buy pieces made from fabrics that you’ve heard of, such as wool, silk, linen, cashmere and cotton. Not only are these more eco-friendly when you wash, but when they’re grown organically, you can be confident in a lessened environmental impact. <br\/><br\/>Organic cotton is a fibre we introduced into our very first collection in 2009.
