If I had to choose one, it would probably be the striped knitted dress.  With a high boot or running around town in a trainer, this is hard to beat. I love the fact that it is cosy personified but chic at the same time. <br\/><br\/>Serena... <br\/><br\/>Admittedly I love it all too, it’s hard to pick just one piece! The “cardigan” is definitely a forever piece , and incredibly versatile perfect for both city and country life. In fact, I have my eye on both colours. <\/p>","text-color":"#000000","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Parker_x_Collagerie_2.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>What was your inspiration for this collection? <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>We started with colour.

I’ll be wearing it everywhere too, from the office,  to meetings around town, to just relaxing at home in the cashmere joggers.  <br\/><br\/><em><strong>Do you have any styling tips for us?<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Look at your skin tone and see which colour ways are the most flattering for you. The skirt flares beautifully so a slouchy high boot is great with this. The dresses look fantastic with a clashing colour trainer or a chunky sole boot. <br\/><br\/>Also, I love to add a pair of flat front flared trousers, usually in white or cream, under knitted dresses. They lengthen the silhouette and make it more personal at the same time. <br\/><br\/>The collection all works perfectly together, but you can also weave each piece into your wardrobe effortlessly. The pink and beige polo neck looks amazing with a vintage Prada skirt I have, and am already plotting when and where to go in that.  <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Chinti_Parker_x_Collagerie_6.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"6224c185-c1dc-4b36-b95f-22b8c5951163":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"059d8e3c-4795-400c-ac7e-e2c67d9eb65d":{"type":"cta","settings":{"title":"Shop our Latest Collab","url":"https:\/\/www.chintiandparker.com\/collections\/chinti-and-parker-meets-miffy","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":32,"cta_bg":"","cta_border_color":"","cta_border":1,"align_text":"center"}}},"block_order":["059d8e3c-4795-400c-ac7e-e2c67d9eb65d"],"settings":{"title":""}},"1664526356db7b40fc":{"type":"featured-products","settings":{"color":"#000000","title":"Featured product","title_font_size":35,"title_padding_bottom":30,"product_list":["black-ribbed-cotton-cashmere-dress","blue-cotton-cashmere-dress","orange-ribbed-cotton-cashmere-dress","black-cashmere-crew-sweater","the-relaxed-polo-cashmere-black"],"width":"productCarousel-new"}}},"order":["blog-title","1663872094552ff4cb","1663868435f0c44a9a","16638720430f34827e","166387311379593d63","166387328793cd4683","6224c185-c1dc-4b36-b95f-22b8c5951163","1664526356db7b40fc"]}
