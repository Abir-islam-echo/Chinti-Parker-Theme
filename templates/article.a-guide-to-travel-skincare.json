How to travel with your skincare<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Due to airport restrictions, carrying liquids in your hand luggage - including skincare products - is limited to 100ml. Luckily, there is an abundance of travel kits on the market, as well as your most loved products in miniature form. Simply pop these into a clear sealed bag inside your hand luggage and you’re ready to fly, or decant your favourites into appropriate containers. <br\/><br\/>If you have a check-in bag, and enough space, bring along your whole routine. Travelling can impact your skin in a number of ways, so it’s best to stick with a known skincare routine, even when on a trip.  <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A_guide_to_travel_skincare_2.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"705e32dc-081a-494e-b430-cf603f47a131":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749841719374__705e32dc-081a-494e-b430-cf603f47a131-16855467274e26bba1-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p><em><strong>3. What to eat before a flight <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>Taking care of yourself doesn’t start when you arrive at your destination. Even something as simple as the journey itself can wreak havoc on your body and skin. If you’re travelling by plane, it’s especially important to plan in advance. <br\/><br\/>You may start your day with a latte, or treat yourself to the traditional airport lounge wine at the start of your vacation, but both caffeine and alcohol can seriously disrupt your quality of sleep. Try to avoid them where possible. <br\/><br\/>The day before you board, avoid “heavy” foods, fatty or spicy meals as these can make your journey uncomfortable. Eat light meals made up of complex carbohydrates and protein to feel fuller for longer and make you less likely to snack on nutrient-deficient foods. <br\/><br\/>Fuelling up before take off, or taking your own healthy snacks on board, can help you opt out of the in-flight meals and salty, processed snacks. Eating the foods we’ve mentioned can help avoid “jet bloat”. <br\/><br\/>What does this have to do with your skin? We all know that our skin can often reflect how we feel on the inside. Flying is tough on your skin to begin with, but nourishing yourself from within can make all the difference when you land. <\/p>","content_color":"#000000","text_font_size":20,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"template--14749841719374__705e32dc-081a-494e-b430-cf603f47a131-16855467274e26bba1-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A_guide_to_travel_skincare_3.jpg","width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749841719374__705e32dc-081a-494e-b430-cf603f47a131-16855467274e26bba1-0","template--14749841719374__705e32dc-081a-494e-b430-cf603f47a131-16855467274e26bba1-1"],"settings":{"title":""}},"ea1ee690-e3fb-4bda-8033-019456aff2db":{"type":"gap","settings":{"margin_top":90,"margin_bottom":0,"margin_top_mobile":0,"margin_bottom_mobile":0}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>4.

Better yet, book a professional facial to thoroughly cleanse your pores and give your skin a new lease of life. <br\/><br\/>Before you travel, use a gentle cleanser and follow with products that will hydrate your skin, such as a toner and serum.

In-flight skincare<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>There’s no reason to let things slip when you’re 34,000 feet in the air. Maintain good skincare practices in-flight and ditch the wipes, however tempting they may be for a quick refresh, and instead, opt for a nourishing face oil. Lack of fresh air and low humidity in the cabin can leave your skin feeling dry, and a face oil - such as jojoba or frankincense - can give your face and neck some much needed rehydration. <br\/><br\/>If you’re in the air overnight, plan ahead and decant your usual products into containers smaller than 100ml, or invest in travel size duplicates. Despite the cramped conditions, try to follow your usual routine in the bathroom before you settle in for even a modicum of sleep. Try using a rich moisturiser before your flight, or pop a travel size in your hand luggage to replenish your skin mid-flight. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A_guide_to_travel_skincare_5.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-right"}},"166387221970bc3eb0":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>6. How flying affects your skin<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Flying, and travelling in general, can dehydrate us quickly, as we’re often too busy to stop and drink water. For flights, the limited liquid allowance can make things tricky, but try increasing your pre-flight water intake for a head start. Once you’re in the air, regularly ask for bottles of water and remember that warm liquids, such as herbal tea and hot water with lemon, also count. Aeroplanes can get cold, so use this as a chance to warm from the inside out. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/A_guide_to_travel_skincare_6.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"d21d0c5f-7b79-4a9a-a2a1-521c57a634e5":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>7.

Your body and skin will feel the benefits of any shut-eye you manage to get; here’s how to get the most rest. <br\/><br\/>Part of getting any rest on a flight, or indeed any mode of transport, relies heavily on what we dress in.
