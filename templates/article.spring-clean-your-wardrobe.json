The big clear out <br\/><\/strong><\/em><br\/>Because of my job, I do have quite a lot of clothes, so I try to have a clear out once a season and get rid of things that I am not wearing. I am probably not as strict as I should be – I am sure my boyfriend would agree – as I am quite sentimental. If you are not wearing something regularly then you have to ask yourself whether you get pleasure out of it, or whether it holds sentimental value, and if the answer is no then it is probably time to let it go. <br\/><br\/>I tend to gift things to friends – that way I feel like I am not saying goodbye to something forever.

Maximise your space<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>I recommend hanging as many of your clothes as possible because that way you can see exactly what you have. I like to group long items such as trousers, dresses, coats and jackets together, and then shorter items such as tops shorts and skirts. <br\/><br\/>It is best to fold jeans, T-shirts and jumpers in such a way that you can still tell what they are when they are stacked up, keeping defining details such as a print or interesting collar in view. This will make life easier when you are getting dressed in the morning.  <br\/><br\/>I tend to swap things out of my wardrobe seasonally to use the available space to its full potential, for instance, I put my heavy winter coats and massive jumpers into sealed storage boxes in the loft over the summer months. <\/p>","content_color":"#000","text_font_size":21,"margin_top":30,"border_top":0,"border_color":"","padding_top":30,"padding_bottom":30,"width":"50%","alignment":"center","align_text":"left"}},"template--14749843456078__dbc55ac6-3bc0-4749-88a6-b64f7e2fb659-168667140088f8189c-1":{"type":"image","disabled":true,"settings":{"width":"50%","alignment":"center","image_alignment":"center"}}},"block_order":["template--14749843456078__dbc55ac6-3bc0-4749-88a6-b64f7e2fb659-168667140088f8189c-0","template--14749843456078__dbc55ac6-3bc0-4749-88a6-b64f7e2fb659-168667140088f8189c-1"],"settings":{"title":""}},"16638720430f34827e":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>3.

Invest wisely<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Once you have your wardrobe well organised, you can really begin to cherish the pieces you have and think carefully about what else you bring in.

You should be looking for things that you are going to keep for a very long time, rather than frivolous throwaway items.
