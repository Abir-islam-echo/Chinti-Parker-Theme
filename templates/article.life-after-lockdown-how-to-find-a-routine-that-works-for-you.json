Take things slowly<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Not everyone is prepared to switch their life back to “normal” again. While some have been craving freedom for months, others are anxious to be around so many people after spending the past year in a bubble. Remember that we are all different and to take things at your own pace. Be gentle with yourself. <br\/><br\/>Small steps and adjustments will make easing back into normal life seem a lot less overwhelming. This could be meeting a friend outside for a coffee or picking up your takeout from a local restaurant rather than choosing home delivery. Next, you could try browsing a local boutique rather than risking a crowded high street. <br\/><br\/>You may find your confidence slowly returns as you become more ready to fully re-enter post-pandemic life.

Rather than ignore these feelings and re-enter the world because you feel like you “have” to, really acknowledge and examine how you are feeling to discover what may be causing it.  <br\/><br\/>It’s perfectly ok to decline invitations or reschedule if you suddenly find things too overwhelming; deal with your feelings in the moment and try again tomorrow.

Look after your mental health <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>Take things one day at a time; forget what the months ahead may hold and focus on today and tomorrow. The pandemic has taught us that there are a great deal of things that we cannot control, but what we can control is what we let impact our mental health. Whether that’s tuning out news or limiting your worries about the future, focus instead on positive coping strategies such as being in nature, exercise and meditation. Curate an environment where your mental health thrives, rather than suffers. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Life_after_lockdown-_How_to_find_a_routine_that_works_for_you_4.jpg","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"def457b7-cc96-4183-a3c6-adee27673d2e":{"type":"custom-content-01","blocks":{"template--14749843062862__def457b7-cc96-4183-a3c6-adee27673d2e-168656055631be81ae-0":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","title_color":"#000","title_font_size":35,"title_font_weight":400,"text":"<p>As addictive as scrolling can be, we all know that social media often presents a false narrative.

If a person’s constant posting of wild parties and shopping trips are making you feel bad, don’t hesitate to unfollow.
