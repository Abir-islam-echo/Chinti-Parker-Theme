Seasonal, locally grown flowers will always be the best quality and last the longest.  Have a look at the website, Flowers from the Farm to find your nearest grower.  Use a mix of shapes in your arrangements to create a good balance.  I wouldn’t suggest using more that 7 varieties though.  Foliage is just as important as the flowers to me. Beach leaf is still in great condition at this time of year, As is jasmine, senecio, Passion flower and geranium leaf.   Dahlias and some of the beautiful chrysanthemums are great as the leading ladies.  Old mans beard is a beautiful foliage, just remove the leaves if you’re not going to use it in water.  <\/p><p>How would you describe your personal style?<br\/><em>Varied. For work I like a good shirt and trousers combo but also a great floaty dress. At home I swing from cashmere or Adidas tracksuits up to full glam depending on the mood.
