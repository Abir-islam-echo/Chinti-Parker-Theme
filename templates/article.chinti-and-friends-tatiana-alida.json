I honestly couldn’t imagine doing anything else. <br\/><\/p><p><br\/><em><strong>How would you describe your aesthetic? <\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>I would describe my work as colourful, whimsical, and feminine. I use watercolour, acrylic, pen, paper, paint, clay, fabrics, and my iPad, but really there is no limit to the materials I like to use and experiment with. <br\/><br\/><br\/><em><strong>What or who inspires your work? <\/strong><\/em><br\/><br\/>I am inspired by a lot of artists, interior design, and film. I have also always had journals and collected artefacts from my life sort of like a personal archive.

I love the fact that the brand is the brainchild of two women, Anna and Rachael, who have an inherent understanding of what women want to feel and look good in. This is so reflective of the women who go through our programme.

I have just started Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens – my mother sent it to me the other day as she loved it so much and can’t stop talking about it. But my most favourite creative outlet is having a coffee or cocktails with friends out in Soho and going to the Royal Academy or National Portrait Gallery. I try once a week to go to an exhibition or gallery and I find viewing other art so inspiring. I spend a lot of time alone working in my studio so for me to be out and about in the bustling city centre taking in all the lively surroundings, people’s outfits and interiors (in normal circumstances) inspires me and gives me a real buzz. <\/p>","text-color":"","grid-image-picker":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screenshot_2023-06-05_at_11.03.55.png","image-caption":"","grid-swap":"grid-left"}},"d21d0c5f-7b79-4a9a-a2a1-521c57a634e5":{"type":"blog-two-grid","settings":{"grid-title":"","grid-title-font-size":35,"title-margin-bottom":20,"grid-title-color":"","content-alignment":"center","grid-content":"<p><em><strong>What would you say to anyone looking to find a new creative outlet?<\/strong><\/em> <br\/><br\/>Order some air-drying clay and make little tea light holders, a paper weight perhaps.
